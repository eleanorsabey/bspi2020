# Introduction

This document is here for me to keep track of what I do each week, mainly for future reference for myself but this may be useful to others if I am working on a similar problem. I am breaking it down week by week and then hopefully by the end of the project I will have a comprehensive report of what I did over the course of the project.

# Week 1
I started by looking at the series matrix, which is a .txt.gz file. This can be dealt with pretty easily in r withe following bit of code that can be found in the file "view_matrix.R":

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dataLocation = {} #User inputs their location to the file
Data = read.table(gzfile(dataLocation), sep="\t", fill=TRUE)
View(Data)
```
